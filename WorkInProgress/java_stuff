All classes extend Object, so Object is the class, and the subclasses are everything. So protected doesnt matter.


The protected modifier specifies that the member can only be accessed
 within its own package (as with package-private) and, in addition, by a subclass of its class in another package.
but since , subclasses of object ,  clone is avaialble for all, so 





subclass A extends Objecgt

subClass B extends Object

Ã© transitivo?

A -> O
B -> O

A-> B
B-> A

Transitivo, comutativo.

can a subclass be subclass of two classes?

class A extends W

class A extends T

class A extends Y

W=T ?

B -> C
C -> B
