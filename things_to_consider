 256 bits =  128 comb of 0 and 1 (prefixes)
       256 / 8 bits = 32bytes
to scan all bits, for better speed, fix at least one bit
for example

for 256 bits, set the first bit (one or zero) making it to scan 128 (less the first bit , which we fixed, and can be 0 or 1)

for catersian product

{ (0,1) ,(0m1) , (0,1) }

since the alrotihm is fast, there is a way to speed up multiplicaton by 2 (shifting bits) (perhaps changing positions)
