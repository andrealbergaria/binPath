7 * 8  = 56 (56 multiplo de 7 e multipl de 8)

Se 56 é multiplo de 7 então tambem é mulitplo de 8

neste caso

4 * 1  =4l
4 * 2  =8
4 * 3 = 16
4 * 4
4 * 5
4 * 6


its infinite


7*8 = 56 ..is 56 multiple of 7 andf 8?

common multiple ...
2*6 = 12
3*6 = 18

can a common multiple exists?? or has one exact factorization
so all mulitple are different 

12 = 2*6
12 = 3*4
12= 3*2*2
this i realted to partition so...i ve done that
each number has a unique set of partitions
so 12 =2*6,
   12 = 3*4
   
   those are All partitions , so since partitions are unique there can't be a common multiple
