1) not know the plaintext
2) get iv
3) block size
4) chosen plain text , attacker can encrypt plaintext
to get key
each plaintext encrypted on non ECB mode , is encrpyted differently,
because IV, and CBC mode

cbc mode :

IV   P1	    P2 		 P3

	C1 		C2		C3
		  usesC1	usesC2
		  
		  quero decifrar C2, 
	if P1 known, then possible,
	else
		known P2 can we get, C2 or C3? no
		on chosen plain text (for example P2), we need the first block (because of CBC)
		else impossible	,
		even knowing the key (like public crypto) we need to know P1
		
		wkipedia
		produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted (already taken care for CBC , useful for CCB)
		it will produce ciphetexts different already based on mode (like cbc)
	idx1   idx2	
		A  A  
		
		C1 C2
		
		C1=C2 ??
 		
		if index < idx1 (don't need iv), all depends on pos1,
		If P1 = P2, all subsquent plaintexts can be decrypted
		if P1 is unknown, then impossible
		
		IV another key?
		
		chosen plaintext ,P2 and C2 and C1 , possible to test the key.
		in CBC mode
				C2 depends on C1
		P1 = C1 = P2 = C2
		
		
	---check IV------
	P1 C1
   C1 XOR P2 => C2
   C1 ="ENC" XOR "ABC" => C2
   no need to use IV, since the cipher texts are different	 
	-------------------------
		
chosen-plaintext
		
	have P2 and C2 (suppopsing CBC mode),
	C2,and C3 known 
	
	C3  =C2 XOR P3
	
	
positions 	1 2 3 4 5 
		  P1 P2 P3 P4 P5
 
cipher    C1 C2 C3 C4 C5


i wonder if i can reduce, Plaintext1 -> Pos1, plaintext are 16bytes, 

Pos1 Pos2 Pos3 Pos4 Pos5 Pos6 Pos7 Pos8


since the cipher text is equal on block to plaintext
so, use Pos1 255, keep adding unitl reached 16 bytes
